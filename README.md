# COVID-19 Transportation Analysis
# 🚦 COVID-19 and County-Level Transportation Patterns

This project investigates how transportation behaviors across ~3,000 U.S. counties changed in response to major COVID-19 milestones, including each county's first reported case and first COVID-related death. Using data from the U.S. Department of Transportation and COVID-19 timelines, we extracted two 14-day windows—before and after each event—to analyze shifts in mobility patterns.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- Cleaned and merged three large datasets: 2020 transportation records, COVID-19 case dates, and COVID-19 death dates
- Isolated event-based time windows for all counties to measure behavioral changes around pandemic milestones
- Generated 30 comparative visualizations using Seaborn to illustrate nationwide trends in public mobility

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- pandas  
- NumPy  
- datetime  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib  

## 🧪 Research Context

This research was conducted under the mentorship of **Dr. H. Andrew Schwartz** (Human Beings Analysis Lab) and in collaboration with **Dr. Mangalik** (Human Beings Analysis Lab) at **Stony Brook University**. The script in this repository is specifically for the analysis we conducted regarding the COVID-19 dates.
